The code in optimal_GNN.py implements a custom neural network architecture with several mathematical concepts. Here’s a breakdown of the key mathematical ideas:

### 1. **Weight Initialization**
- Uses **He initialization**:  
  For each layer, weights are initialized as  
  ```
  W ~ N(0, sqrt(2 / prev_dim))
  ```
  This helps maintain stable gradients during training.

### 2. **Scar Operator**
- Computes pairwise multiplicative interactions between elements of a layer’s output, scaled by 0.02:  
  ```
  scar_value = sum_{i < j} (z[i] * z[j]) * 0.02
  ```
  This is added to the layer’s output to enhance contradiction detection.

### 3. **Activation Functions**
- **ReLU**:  
  ```
  relu(x) = max(0, x)
  ```
  Introduces non-linearity and helps with gradient flow.
- **Softmax**:  
  ```
  softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum_j exp(x_j)
  ```
  Converts output logits to probabilities for classification.

### 4. **Forward Pass**
- For each hidden layer:  
  ```
  z = input @ W.T + b
  z_enhanced = z + scar_value
  a = relu(z_enhanced)
  ```
- For output layer:  
  ```
  z_output = last_hidden @ W_output.T + b_output
  a_output = softmax(z_output)
  ```

### 5. **Adaptive Learning Rate**
- Learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on scar activity and epoch:  
  ```
  lr = base_lr * (1 + scar_activity * 3) * (1 / (1 + epoch * 0.01))
  ```
  This boosts learning when contradictions are detected.

### 6. **Backpropagation**
- Gradients are computed for each layer and scaled by substrate factors:  
  ```
  substrate_scale = lr * (1 + scar_activity * 8)
  W -= substrate_scale * dW
  b -= substrate_scale * db
  ```
  This amplifies updates when contradictions are high.

### 7. **Dataset Generation**
- Creates a dataset with contradictory class boundaries using:
  - **Multiplicative parity**: `np.prod(features[:5]) > 0`
  - **Additive contradiction**: `np.sum(features[5:]) < 0`
  - **Boundary contradiction**: `features[0] * features[-1] < 0`
- Assigns classes based on combinations of these conditions.

**Summary:**  
The mathematics combines standard neural network operations (matrix multiplication, activation functions, softmax) with custom enhancements (scar operator, adaptive learning rate, substrate scaling) to handle highly contradictory datasets. The scar operator and substrate scaling are unique features designed to boost the network’s ability to detect and adapt to contradictions in the data.
